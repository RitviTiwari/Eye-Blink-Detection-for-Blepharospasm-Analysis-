# Eye-Blink-Detection-for-Blepharospasm-Analysis-

# Overview:
This project focuses on detecting abnormal blinking patterns to identify potential cases of blepharospasm, a condition characterized by involuntary eye blinking. Using real-time eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculations, the system accurately counts blinks and provides insights for medical applications.

# Features:
Real-Time Blink Detection: Leverages webcam input to process and analyze eye blinks in real-time.

EAR Calculation: Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine blinking events and detect abnormal blinking rates.

Blepharospasm Analysis: Classifies blinking rates to detect potential signs of blepharospasm.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

OpenCV: For image and video processing

Dlib: For facial landmark detection

NumPy: For mathematical computations
